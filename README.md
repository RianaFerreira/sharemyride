# ShareMyRide - General Assembly WDI Assignment 2 Week 8

This application is for anyone who would like to share a trip by car within Australia. It's like virtual hitchhiking for someone who may be travelling the same route. Share the trip, get to know someone new and share the costs, if you're interested.

## WISHLIST
*  click on the logo to go back to the home page, it's a nice common usability touch worth considering
*  a few suggested trips in the home page, this is more of a personal thing
*  feedback for the user when I click something until I realised I booked 5 times
*  ability to cancel booking?
*  more consistent user experience, for example I cannot confidently guess what some links will take me
